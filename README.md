# Car_Sales_Price_Prediction

## Dataset Description:

This data set has being taken from the Analytixlabs for the purpose of car sales price prediction. Each record in the dataset describes a Car. The various attributes present in the dataset are as follows : 

- Manufacturer
- Model
- Sales in thousands
- Year resale value
- Vehicle type
- Price in thousands
- Engine size
- Horsepower
- Wheelbase
- Width
- Length
- Curb weight
- Fuel capacity
- Fuel efficiency
- Latest Launch
- Power performance factor

The target variable is Price in thousands. 

## Problem statement:

The Car Sales Price Prediction is one of the famous Machine Learning Regression problem. Here, we built a predictive model using the cars data (i.e., Car Manufacturer, Sales in thousands, Year resale value, Price in thousands, Engine size, Horsepower, etc).

This is a regression problem in machine learning as we are predicting the sales price of the cars using the given attributes.

We used Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) and R-squared value as the evaluation metrics for this problem.
